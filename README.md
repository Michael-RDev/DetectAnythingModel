# ViT Image Classification using Transformers

This is a Python code snippet that demonstrates how to use the Vision Transformer (ViT) model for image classification using the transformers library. The ViT model was introduced in the paper "An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale" and achieved state-of-the-art results on the ImageNet dataset.
